 Task Description

This project is a QA Automation trainee task implemented in Java 11.  

The program does the following:

1. Prints "Hello" if the entered number is greater than 7.  
2. Prints "Hello, John" if the entered name is "John", otherwise prints "There is no such name".  
3. Outputs elements of a numeric array that are multiples of 3.  
   - If no multiples of 3 exist, it prints a message: `"There are no elements that are multiples of 3."`  

Additionally, the program answers the given bracket sequence question in this README.

 Questions

Given bracket sequence: `[((())()(())]]`

- Can this sequence be considered correct?  
   No, the brackets are unbalanced — there’s one extra closing bracket.  
- What needs to be changed to make it correct?  
   Replace the last `]` with `)` → correct version: [((())()(()))]
